Need to receive ticket from AD on linux workstation.

Vim /etc/krb5.conf

And change it to :

[logging]
default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log
kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log

[libdefaults]
default_realm = CARBONITEINC.COM
dns_lookup_realm = true
dns_lookup_kdc = true
ticket_lifetime = 24h
renew_lifetime = 7d
forwardable = true

[realms]
CARBONITEINC.COM = {
  kdc = bos-dc1.carboniteinc.com
  admin_server = bos-dc1.carboniteinc.com
}

{carboniteinc.com} = {
}

[domain_realm]
.carboniteinc.com = CARBONITEINC.COM
carboniteinc.com = CARBONITEINC.COM

2. Receive ticket:

Kinit your_username_in_AD

(please don’t use kinit username@ad.server – it doesn’t work)

You can list all tickets with the
Klist

3. Run the command with chef
knife winrm -m sst2.carboniteinc.com ipconfig -t ssl -x 'adusername' -R CARBONITEINC.COM

ipconfig as example. You can put there any. I tried
knife winrm -m sst2.carboniteinc.com ‘chef-client -c c:/chef/client.rb -j c:/chef/first-boot.json -E _default’ -x 'adusername' -R CARBONITEINC.COM

You can try to run powershell script etc instead of this command.

I changed AllowUnecncrypted = false. But we may check the traffic with the sniffer. But there no password in any case.

Need to check some errors with bootstrap. I will update you later about it.
